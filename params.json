Authors\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\n   dawnhttpd (Dawn HTTP deamon), derived from darkhttpd, is a simple web\r\n   server written in portable ANSI C. It supports static pages, and MIME\r\n   type based handlers. It can drop privileges before accepting connections;\r\n   and, it can log received requests. It can log POST request data in a\r\n   guestbook. It can, easily, be used in conjunction with Lighttpd as proxy.\r\n   It compiles and runs on 32 and 64 bits computers.\r\n\r\n\r\nBUILDING\r\n\r\n   Install dawnhttpd by running the following commands, as root:\r\n   make && make install\r\n\r\n\r\nCONFIGURATION\r\n\r\n   No configuration, see README.cmd.txt for commands.\r\n\r\n\r\nBUGS\r\n\r\n   Strange bug in the tuple_cmp function. Debug to see if it occurs \r\n   on your computer, where the const parameter o2 gets reset to NULL.\r\n\r\n   Bug reports, patches and suggestions are much appreciated.  \r\n   See the GitHub account https://www.github.com/dev-breeze-com/dawnhttpd\r\n\r\nAUTHORS\r\n\r\n   Pierre Innocent ( dev@breezeos.com )  \r\n   The Breeze::OS website: http://www.breezeos.com\r\n\r\n",
