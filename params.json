Authors\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n============\r\n\r\n   dawnhttpd (Dawn HTTP deamon), derived from darkhttpd, is a simple web\r\n   server written in portable ANSI C. It supports static pages, and MIME\r\n   type based handlers. It can drop privileges before accepting connections;\r\n   and, it can log received requests. It can log POST request data in a\r\n   guestbook. It can, easily, be used in conjunction with Lighttpd as proxy.\r\n   It compiles and runs on 32 and 64 bits computers.\r\n\r\n\r\nBUILDING\r\n========\r\n\r\n   Install dawnhttpd by running the following commands, as root:\r\n   make && make install\r\n   copy settings.ini to /etc/dawnhttpd/\r\n\r\n\r\nCONFIGURATION\r\n=============\r\n\r\n   INI-style configuration was added, in the updated version.\r\n   See README.cmd.txt for commands.\r\n   Guestbook entry keys should be encased by '<%' and '%>'.\r\n\r\n\r\nBUGS\r\n====\r\n\r\n   Strange bug in the tuple_cmp function. Debug to see if it occurs \r\n   on your computer, where the const parameter o2 gets reset to NULL.\r\n   Bug reports, patches and suggestions are much appreciated.  \r\n   See the GitHub account https://www.github.com/dev-breeze-com/dawnhttpd\r\n\r\n\r\nFun Facts\r\n========= \r\n\r\n   On an AMD Athlon64 X2 (Mem 1G) running Linux 3.10.104-amd64, we get  \r\n   weighttp -n 100000 -c 375 -k -H 'User-Agent: Weighttp' 127.0.0.1:8 0  \r\n   weighttp - a lightweight and simple webserver benchmarking tool  \r\n   starting benchmark...  \r\n   spawning thread #1: 375 concurrent requests, 100000 total requests  \r\n   progress: 10% done  \r\n   ...  \r\n   progress: 100% done  \r\n   finished in 10 sec, 919 millisec and 115 microsec, 9158 req/s, 79580 kbyte/s  \r\n   requests: 100000 total, 100000 started, 100000 done, 100000 succeeded, 0 failed, 0 errored  \r\n   status codes: 100000 2xx, 0 3xx, 0 4xx, 0 5xx  \r\n   traffic: 889800000 bytes total, 22000000 bytes http, 867800000 bytes data  \r\n\r\n\r\nAUTHORS\r\n=======\r\n\r\n   Pierre Innocent ( dev@breezeos.com )  \r\n   The Breeze::OS website: http://www.breezeos.com\r\n\r\n",
