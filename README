== INTRODUCTION ==
   dawnhttpd (Dawn HTTP deamon), derived from darkhttpd, is a simple web
   server written in portable ANSI C. It supports static pages, and MIME
   type based handlers. It can drop privileges before accepting connections;
   and, it can log received requests. It can log POST request data in a
   guestbook. It can, easily, be used in conjunction with Lighttpd as proxy.
   It compiles and runs on 32 and 64 bits computers.


== BUILDING ==
   Install dawnhttpd by running the following commands, as root:
   make && make install


== CONFIGURATION ==
   No configuration, see README.cmd.txt for commands.


== BUGS ==
   Strange bug in the tuple_cmp function. Debug to see if it occurs 
   on your computer, where the const parameter o2 gets reset to NULL.

   Bug reports, patches and suggestions are much appreciated.
